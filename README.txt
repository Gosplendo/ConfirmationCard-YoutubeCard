This confirmation-pack has two cards: Contact Confirmation & An Assembly Video 

Contact Confirmation:
	This card retrieves data from API endpoint and divides the data into 3 categories: Address, Phone, and Email.
	All categories are split into three different Dialog Buttons. When a dialog is opened the information regarding that category is displayed.
	Once this information is shown, the user can either confirm information (updates DateTime associated with category)
	or edit the information (new tab to deeplink).
	
Assemblies Video:
	This card embeds an unlisted informational YouTube video about assemblies. If a user clicks on the white portions of the card (not the title)
	then the card will open up into a page and display the video there.
